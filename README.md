Employee Analysis Report – ABC Company


ABC Company aims to understand employee distribution, salary expenditures, and demographic patterns within various teams and positions. This analysis helps identify key trends and insights that can drive workforce planning and compensation strategies.
________________________________________
1. Employee Distribution Across Teams
•	Employees are distributed across multiple teams, with the New Orleans Pelicans having the highest number of employees (19 employees, 4.15% of the total workforce).
•	Other teams show relatively balanced distributions, with most having around 15 employees each.
•	This indicates a well-distributed workforce across teams, but certain teams may require more hiring efforts or restructuring.
2. Employee Distribution by Position
•	The Shooting Guard (SG) position is the most common in the company, followed closely by Power Forwards (PF) and Point Guards (PG).
•	The Center (C) position has the fewest employees (79), which could suggest a scarcity of talent or lower demand for that role.
3. Age Group Analysis
•	The majority of employees fall in the 18-25 age group (200 employees), followed by the 26-30 group (167 employees).
•	There are very few employees above 35 years old, with almost no representation beyond 40 years.
•	This suggests that the company primarily employs younger talent, potentially fresh graduates or early-career professionals.
4. Salary Expenditure – By Team & Position
Teams with the Highest Salary Expenditure
•	Cleveland Cavaliers lead in salary expenditure ($106,988,689), followed by Los Angeles Clippers ($94,854,640) and Oklahoma City Thunder ($93,765,298).
•	Some teams have significantly lower salary budgets, suggesting salary disparities across teams.
Positions with the Highest Salary Expenditure
•	Centers (C) receive the highest salary allocation ($466,377,332), followed by Point Guards (PG - $446,848,971) and Power Forwards (PF - $442,560,850).
•	This could indicate that these positions require highly skilled or specialized employees, leading to higher compensation.
5. Correlation Between Age and Salary
•	The correlation coefficient between Age and Salary is weak (~0.2 - 0.3), suggesting no strong relationship between the two variables.
•	This implies that salary increases are not directly tied to age but may depend on other factors such as experience, performance, or position.
